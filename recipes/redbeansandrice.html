        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Red beans and rice is a southern favorite dish, popular in Lousiana. The dish may traditionally is cooked with Ham Hocks however, I prefer to substitute that with andouille sausage. Although, you may switch the sasuage with a regular smoked beef sasuage for a more mild dish.</p>
